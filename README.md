## A Friendly Request Regarding GitHub Organization Name Transfer

Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is [Mikhail](https://github.com/mgerasimchuk), and I'm the creator of a product called "teamcoding," a platform for programming courses.

Recently, I came across a GitHub organization account that currently holds the username "TeamCoding."
I noticed that this account has not been active for the past eleven years.

I'm reaching out to kindly request if it would be possible for you to consider releasing the username "TeamCoding" so that I can use it for my product.

Having a GitHub account with the username "teamcoding" would significantly contribute to my project's identity and branding.
In the near future, I plan to use it to publish open-source code and snippets for students.
This is crucial for my project's development.

I'm very hopeful that this can be possible, and if you have any additional questions regarding my request, I'll be glad to answer them.

Thank you in advance,
Mikhail

PS:

I already own the resources https://teamcoding.ru, https://www.youtube.com/@teamcoding, https://www.instagram.com/teamcoding, https://twitter.com/teamcoding, And it would be extremely positive for me if you could allow me to use your organization name.
